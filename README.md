## Introduction

**3D Teeth Segmentation using PointNet** is an advanced deep learning project designed to automate the segmentation of teeth from 3D dental scans. Leveraging the power of PointNet—a neural network architecture specifically crafted for handling point cloud data—this project addresses the challenges associated with accurate and efficient dental segmentation. Precise segmentation is crucial for various dental applications, including orthodontic planning, prosthodontics, and oral surgery, thereby enhancing both diagnostic capabilities and treatment outcomes.
