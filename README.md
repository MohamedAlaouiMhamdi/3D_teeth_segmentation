## Introduction

**3D Teeth Segmentation using PointNet** is an advanced deep learning project designed to automate the segmentation of teeth from 3D dental scans. Leveraging the power of PointNet—a neural network architecture specifically crafted for handling point cloud data—this project addresses the challenges associated with accurate and efficient dental segmentation. Precise segmentation is crucial for various dental applications, including orthodontic planning, prosthodontics, and oral surgery, thereby enhancing both diagnostic capabilities and treatment outcomes.

## Features

- **Direct Point Cloud Processing**: Utilizes PointNet to handle raw 3D point cloud data without the need for voxelization, preserving geometric integrity.
- **Advanced Data Preprocessing**: Implements noise reduction, normalization, and data augmentation techniques to enhance data quality and model robustness.
- **High-Accuracy Segmentation**: Achieves superior segmentation performance through optimized model architecture and training strategies.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Incorporates both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations to assess model effectiveness.
- **Error Analysis**: Identifies common segmentation errors, providing insights for future improvements.

## Dataset

### Description

The dataset comprises 3D dental scans obtained from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) machines. Each scan is represented as a point cloud with XYZ coordinates and associated labels for different dental structures, enabling precise segmentation tasks.

### Error Analysis

The model occasionally misclassifies adjacent teeth with similar geometrical features and struggles with areas having low point density due to occlusions or scanning limitations. These errors highlight the need for enhanced local feature capture and more diverse training data.

## Tips for Customizing Your README

1. **Replace Placeholder Text**: Ensure all placeholders (e.g., `path/to/logo.png`, `path/to/sample_segmentation.png`, `your.email@example.com`, etc.) are replaced with your actual content and file paths.
2. **Add Visuals**: High-quality images and figures significantly enhance the readability and attractiveness of your README. Include sample segmentations, diagrams of the PointNet architecture, and any other relevant visuals.
3. **Detailed Metrics**: If you have more metrics or different evaluation criteria, feel free to expand the quantitative results section.
4. **Update Acknowledgements**: Ensure all contributors, tools, and libraries that significantly impacted your project are acknowledged.
5. **Link to Documentation**: If you have additional documentation or a project website, include links in the appropriate sections.
6. **Consistent Formatting**: Use Markdown syntax consistently for headings, lists, tables, and other elements to maintain a clean and professional appearance.
7. **Project Status**: Optionally, include a section indicating the project's current status (e.g., active development, completed, etc.) or future plans.
8. **Badges**: Consider adding badges (e.g., license, build status, GitHub stars) at the top to provide quick insights into the project.
