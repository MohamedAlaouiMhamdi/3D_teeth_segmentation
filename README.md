## Introduction

**3D Teeth Segmentation using PointNet** is an advanced deep learning project designed to automate the segmentation of teeth from 3D dental scans. Leveraging the power of PointNet—a neural network architecture specifically crafted for handling point cloud data—this project addresses the challenges associated with accurate and efficient dental segmentation. Precise segmentation is crucial for various dental applications, including orthodontic planning, prosthodontics, and oral surgery, thereby enhancing both diagnostic capabilities and treatment outcomes.

## Dataset

### Description

The dataset comprises 3D dental scans obtained from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) machines. Each scan is represented as a point cloud with XYZ coordinates and associated labels for different dental structures, enabling precise segmentation tasks.

### Acquisition

- **Source**: Collected from XYZ Dental Clinic *(replace with your actual source)*
- **Format**: PLY/OBJ files
- **Size**: 500 dental scans *(replace with your actual dataset size)*
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Noise removal using statistical filters
  - Outlier detection and exclusion
  - Normalization to fit within a unit sphere
  - Data augmentation through rotation, scaling, and translation

### Access

- **Public Dataset**: [Link to dataset](https://example.com/dataset) *(if publicly available)*
- **Private Dataset**: Contact [your.email@example.com](mailto:your.email@example.com) for access.

### Error Analysis

The model occasionally misclassifies adjacent teeth with similar geometrical features and struggles with areas having low point density due to occlusions or scanning limitations. These errors highlight the need for enhanced local feature capture and more diverse training data.
